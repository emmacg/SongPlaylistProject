PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Brief:
To create a CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) application, utilising supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that  encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

A Jira board with user stories, use cases and tasks.
Documentation from a design phase describing architecture. 
A functional application created in the OOP language.
Functioning frontend and API.
Full testing.
Code fully integrated into Version Control System (GitHub).

To meet this brief, I created an application that would list music in the form of a playlist. This is to be an application where songs can be entered, stored and deleted. Displaying artist name and song title for the user to refer to. Songs being entered into the playlist is to utilise the Create functionality, songs being removed is to utilise the Delete functionality, the songs within the database being displayed is to utilise the Read functionality and the ability to change and update current songs within the playlist is to utilise the Update functionality.



Building the Project - JIRA


In order to keep track of the project, including goals and tasks, a Jira board would be created utilising an Agile Scrum method. Within this Jira board, Epics are to encapsulate the main aspects of the project, within these user stories would provide insight into specific goals and subtasks are utilised to keep track of progress and backlogs. A sprint was created for each epic to maintain focus on time management. Once all tasks were completed, the sprints were marked as finalised.

Example user story: 

“As a user I want to be able to add songs to the playlist so that I can have an updated personalised playlist.”

DATABASE

My SQL WorkBench was utilised for the Database in this project. Postman was used for testing the database. H2 Database for testing and MySQL was for production. 

BACKEND

The Backend was created using Java, through the framework of SpringBoot within Eclipse. This was chosen as it simplifies the process of building the backend and allows for faster production. 


FRONTEND

The Frontend was created using Visual Studio Code, utilising HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

TESTING

Unit testing using Mockito to test components in isolation. This allows an understanding of fundamental aspects of the application and how they are operating in isolation.
Integration Testing using Postman to test HTTP requests of integrated components. This tests the communication between each fundamental aspect of the application. 
Selenium Testing to validate applications across browsers and platforms to ensure that all frontend areas have been covered.


PROGRESSION 
More tables can be created within the database and joined to current database to add more functionality.

Songs within the playlist can link to a search function, where the songs will be located in applications (i.e. YouTube) and automatically played. This can be implemented using JavaScript.


SUMMARY

Developed a CRUD application with full functionality of Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Easy to use and readable user experience.
Completed all tests to ensure application functioning in backend and front end.
Utilised Jira and Github for project tracking and version control. 


LIMITATIONS

GitHub regular upload could have been improved for better tracking of versions throughout. 

Jira consistency could also have been improved for better planning. 

Further focus on testing would be beneficial to understand in more detail.

Adding more functionality and attempting more within the project could have been beneficial.

Better time management would have allowed for more progression, risk taking and overall capabilities of the application development.
